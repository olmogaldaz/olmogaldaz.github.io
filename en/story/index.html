          <h2>The story</h2>

          <p>This is the birth certificate under which Olmo Gómez Aldaz was registered at the Civil Registry of Bilbao. It is an apparently ordinary administrative document: name, surnames, date and place. In this case, however, it marks the beginning of an identity theft, as the registered data do not correspond to his real biological origin.</p>

          <p>A civil registry entry does not merely describe a person: it creates one in legal terms. From this certificate, a fictitious civil identity is constructed —name, filiation, kinship and legal effects— which displaces and conceals any other. For decades, this registered identity operated as the only truth recognised by the State, conditioning all civil and administrative acts of the person concerned.</p>

          <p>The subsequent reconstruction of origin relies on documentary verification, historical archives and genetic evidence. This body of proof makes it possible to contrast the imposed civil identity with the real biological filiation and to sustain the claim on evidentiary, not narrative, grounds.</p>

          <p>The process culminates in judicial rulings that recognise biological filiation without annulling the previous adoptive filiation, resulting in a new situation of dual filiation with full civil effects. This solution, unprecedented in comparative legal practice, constitutes an innovative international precedent in the field of identity restitution, as it allows biological truth to be restored without erasing the imposed legal history.</p>
