    <h2>The complaint and the judicial claims</h2>
    <p>
      The judicial course of this case is structured in several distinct phases.
      In 2021, an initial criminal complaint was filed in Bilbao regarding the
      acts related to identity misappropriation. That complaint was dismissed
      on the grounds of statutory limitation and, after being appealed, was
      dismissed again for the same reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel, a civil claim was initiated in Pamplona seeking both the
      annulment of the adoption and the recognition of biological filiation.
      In that proceeding, the annulment of the adoption was not resolved,
      while the filiation was ultimately recognised by the courts, giving rise
      to the decision presented in the sentence section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequently, and in light of what was resolved regarding filiation,
      a new civil claim seeking the annulment of the adoption has been filed,
      this time before the courts of Bilbao. This procedure is currently
      pending.
