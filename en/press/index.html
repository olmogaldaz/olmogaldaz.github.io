      <h3>Legal media</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>most recent relevant coverage</strong> of the case was published on
        <strong>5 February 2026</strong> by the legal outlet <em>Law &amp; Trends</em>,
        which analysed the ruling from a strictly technical legal perspective.
        The article, entitled
        <em>“A landmark ruling confirms dual filiation, biological and adoptive”</em>,
        focuses on the legal scope of the decision, its novel character and its
        practical consequences. This piece is not the result of the outlet’s own
        investigation, but rather a legal analysis based on a previous agency report
        distributed by <strong>EFE</strong>, which acts as the primary source of the facts.
      </p>

      <h3>Agencies and cascading effect</h3>
      <p>
        This news cycle began with a
        <strong>press release issued by the affected person himself</strong> following
        the update of his surnames in the national identity document. The press release
        was circulated on the <strong>morning of 20 January 2026</strong> and on that same
        day led to <strong>multiple direct contacts</strong> from various media outlets,
        including <em>Europa Press</em>, <em>El Mundo – Diario de Valladolid</em>,
        <em>Diario de Navarra</em> and <em>El Correo</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In parallel with these initial contacts, some outlets launched their own
        coverage at local and regional level, with interviews and pieces produced
        directly with the affected person. From that point onwards, a cascading
        effect followed which, over the subsequent days and weeks, generated
        publications in the written press, as well as interviews and news segments
        on radio (SER, Vive Radio) and television (RTVE, CyLTV), all of them linked
        to the new fact of the effective restoration of the surnames in the identity
        document.
      </p>

      <h3>Earlier coverage</h3>
      <p>
        Prior to the news cycle that began in January 2026, an article was published
        on <strong>19 September 2025</strong> in <em>Jot Down</em> entitled
        <em>“The right to recover biological surnames while preserving adoption”</em>,
        written by <strong>Iván Gastañaga</strong>. This was an
        <strong>opinion and analysis</strong> piece rather than a news report, and its
        interest lies in its broader reflection on the case and its implications,
        without seeking to report new facts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most relevant earlier piece of coverage is the
        <strong>investigative article</strong> published by <em>Público</em> on
        <strong>4 July 2025</strong>, entitled
        <em>“A landmark ruling restores biological filiation to a man adopted through a stolen babies network”</em>,
        written by <strong>Ana María Pascual</strong>. This article examined the case
        in greater depth and had a significant impact due to its approach.
        Subsequently, the article was removed from the outlet’s website in a process
        of self-censorship that also forms part of the media history of the case.
