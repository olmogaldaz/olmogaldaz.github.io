  <p>Olmo Gómez Aldaz</p>

  <p>
    This site brings together materials, documents and reflections around a process of identity
    restitution initiated in adulthood and recognised by the courts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not as a closed narrative, but as an archive under construction.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>
      A biography crossed by false data, prolonged absences and a historical context that explains
      why certain practices were possible. This section situates the facts, the silences and the
      documents necessary to understand the origin of the case and the need to narrate it.

    <h2>The sentence</h2>
    <p>
      The judicial ruling is not presented as a final point, but as a milestone within a broader
      process. The recognition of biological filiation without annulling the adoptive one introduces
      an unprecedented legal situation in Spain and opens a new framework from which to observe its
      legal and personal implications.

    <h2>The books</h2>
    <p>
      The books linked to this project do not respond to a single record or a closed intention.
      They arise from the need to organise materials, experiences and reflections that do not fit
      into a single format. Writing, memory and archive intersect as part of the same process.
