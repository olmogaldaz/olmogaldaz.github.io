      This site brings together materials, documents and reflections around a process of identity restitution initiated in adulthood and recognised by the courts.

      Not as a closed narrative, but as an archive under construction.

      <h2>The story</h2>
      <p>
        A biography crossed by false data, prolonged absences and a historical context that explains why certain practices were possible. This section situates the facts, the silences and the documents necessary to understand the origin of the case and the need to narrate it.

      <h2>The sentence</h2>
      <p>
        The judicial ruling is not presented as a final point, but as a milestone within a broader process. The recognition of biological filiation without annulling the adoptive one introduces an unprecedented legal situation in Spain and opens a new framework from which to observe its legal and personal implications.

      <h2>The books</h2>
      <p>
        The books linked to this project do not respond to a single record or a closed intention. They arise from the need to organise materials, experiences and reflections that do not fit into a single format. Writing, memory and archive intertwine as part of the same process.
