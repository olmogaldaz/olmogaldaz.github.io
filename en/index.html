  <h1 class="page-title subtle">Olmo Gómez Aldaz Case</h1>

  <p>
    This site brings together materials, documents and reflections around a process of identity
    restitution initiated in adulthood and recognised by the courts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not as a closed narrative, but as an archive under construction.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>
      A biography shaped by false records, prolonged absences and a historical context that explains
      how certain practices were possible. This section situates the facts, the silences and the
      documents needed to understand the origin of the case and the need to tell it.

    <!-- CLAIM -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>The legal claim</h2>
      <p>
        The legal claim sets out the attempt to restore identity through judicial means. It brings together the facts, the documentation submitted, and the legal grounds supporting the request for the restitution of name, filiation, and registral truth.

    <h2>The sentence</h2>
    <p>
      The judicial ruling is not presented as a final point, but as a milestone within a broader
      process. The recognition of biological filiation without annulling the adoptive one introduces
      an unprecedented legal situation in Spain and opens a new framework from which to observe its
      legal and personal implications.

    <h2>The books</h2>
    <p>
      The books connected to this project do not belong to a single register or a closed intention.
      They arise from the need to organise materials, lived experience, and reflections that do not
      fit into a single format. Writing, memory, and archive intersect as part of the same process.

    <h2>The author</h2>
    <p>
      The author cannot be separated from the process of identity restitution itself. Rather than a
      linear trajectory, what emerges is a path shaped by revisiting the past, gaining access to
      documentation, and rebuilding one’s own name from the present.

    <h2>Press</h2>
    <p>
      Media coverage is part of how the case has unfolded. The different reports show how the facts
      become a public narrative, and how each outlet adds its own nuances, emphasis, and framing.
      Bringing them together here makes it possible to follow that evolution.
