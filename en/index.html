  <h1 class="page-title subtle">Olmo Gómez Aldaz Case</h1>

  <p>
    This site brings together materials, documents and reflections around a process of identity
    restitution initiated in adulthood and recognised by the courts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not as a closed narrative, but as an archive under construction.

    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>
      A biography shaped by false records, prolonged absences and a historical context that explains
      how certain practices were possible. This section situates the facts, the silences and the
      documents needed to understand the origin of the case and the need to tell it.

    <h2>The sentence</h2>
    <p>
      The judicial ruling is not presented as a final point, but as a milestone within a broader
      process. The recognition of biological filiation without annulling the adoptive one introduces
      an unprecedented legal situation in Spain and opens a new framework from which to observe its
      legal and personal implications.

    <h2>The books</h2>
    <p>
      The books linked to this project do not follow a single register or a closed intention. They 
      arise from the need to organise materials, lived experience, and reflections that do not fit 
      within a single format. Writing, memory, and archive intersect as part of the same process.

    <h2>The author</h2>
    <p>
      The figure of the author is inseparable from the process of identity restitution itself. Rather 
      than a linear trajectory, what emerges is a path shaped by the re-examination of the past, access
      to documentation, and the reconstruction of one’s own name from the present.

    <h2>Press</h2>
    <p>
      The media coverage is part of the development of the case. The different reports make it 
      possible to observe how the facts are translated into a public narrative and how each outlet 
      introduces its own nuances, emphases, and framing. Bringing them together here allows that 
      evolution to be followed.
