  <p>Olmo Gómez Aldaz</p>

  <p>
    This site brings together materials, documents and reflections around a process of identity
    restitution initiated in adulthood and recognised by the courts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not as a closed narrative, but as an archive under construction.

    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>
      A biography shaped by false records, prolonged absences and a historical context that explains
      how certain practices were possible. This section situates the facts, the silences and the
      documents needed to understand the origin of the case and the need to tell it.

    <h2>The sentence</h2>
    <p>
      The judicial ruling is not presented as a final point, but as a milestone within a broader
      process. The recognition of biological filiation without annulling the adoptive one introduces
      an unprecedented legal situation in Spain and opens a new framework from which to observe its
      legal and personal implications.

    <h2>The books</h2>
    <p>
      The books linked to this project do not respond to a single record or a closed intention. They
      arise from the need to organise materials, experiences and reflections that do not fit into a
      single format. Writing, memory and archive intersect as part of the same process.
