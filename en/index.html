    The Battle for the Identity of Olmo Gómez Aldaz
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    At first glance, Olmo Gómez Aldaz had built a normal life, had started a family, and lived much like anyone else. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    However, what happened to him at birth is neither ordinary nor something that should ever have occurred. He was taken and adopted without the legitimate and free consent of his biological parents.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Decades later, he brought that history before the courts. The rulings recognized his biological filiation without annulling the adoptive one and established a situation of dual filiation that is now legally firm. The annulment of the adoption remains an open matter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As he states:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote class="legal-quote">
    <em>“This space is my public response to what happened: a way to explain it, place it in context, and leave a public record of it, because in cases like this, oblivion is an accomplice of the perpetrators of this harm.”</em>
  </blockquote>
