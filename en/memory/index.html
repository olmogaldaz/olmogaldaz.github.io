      <h2>Declaration of Recognition and Personal Reparation</h2>

      <p>
        The Declaration of Recognition and Personal Reparation issued on 19 February 2026 formally acknowledges the abduction suffered by Olmo Gómez Aldaz and is the result of a long process. To understand its full meaning, it is necessary to recall the previous stages: the administrative suppression of his biological identity, the judicial recovery of his filiation, and the subsequent formal request for recognition as a victim under Law 20/2022 on Democratic Memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1971, Olmo Gómez Aldaz was abducted and adopted without the legitimate and free consent of his biological parents. The alteration of filiation was incorporated into the civil registry as if it were a regular and definitive situation, giving it an appearance of legality and closing, for decades, any institutional questioning. His biological identity was therefore annulled and erased.
      </p>

      <p>
        This situation began to reverse through personal investigation, genetic evidence, and judicial proceedings that culminated in the double filiation rulings delivered in 2024 and 2025. In those decisions, the courts formally declared his biological identity and the coexistence of double filiation with full civil effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, those rulings addressed a matter of filiation, not the nature of the acts that made such litigation necessary. They declared identity, but they did not legally qualify the abduction and adoption without consent as an illegitimate act linked to a context of repression, nor did they recognize victim status.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because civil recognition proved insufficient, a formal request for recognition was submitted under Law 20/2022. The book <em>DOGA 2025: The Battle for My Identity</em> documents and articulates that request. It sets out the historical and legal reasoning showing that the 1971 abduction was not an isolated episode, but an event embedded in a broader context of rights violations during the dictatorship.
      </p>

      <p>
        On 19 February 2026, the Government of Spain responded to that request by issuing the Declaration of Recognition and Personal Reparation, signed by the competent minister and officially registered. This constitutes an institutional and formal acknowledgment of the abduction and of victim status.
      </p>

      <p>In the Declaration, it is expressly stated:</p>

      <blockquote class="legal-quote">

        <strong>Declaration of Recognition and Personal Reparation</strong><br><br>

        <em>“it has been established that […] he suffered persecution for political and ideological reasons during the Franco dictatorship.”</em>
        <br><br>
        <em>“in 1971 he was abducted and adopted without the legitimate and free consent of his parents.”</em>
        <br><br>
        <em>“his circumstances qualify him as a ‘victim’ under Article 3.1 of Law 20/2022.”</em>

        <div class="signature">
          Ángel Víctor Torres Pérez<br>
          Minister for Territorial Policy and Democratic Memory<br><br>

      </blockquote>

      <p>
        With this Declaration, the State expressly affirms that in 1971 an abduction and adoption occurred without legitimate and free consent, and that this act was illegitimate within the context of the dictatorship. This is not merely a historical reference; it is an institutional qualification of the facts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Declaration does not replace the double filiation rulings that recognized Olmo Gómez Aldaz’s biological identity, but it completes their scope. Until then, the State had judicially recognized who he was, but it had not affirmed the existence of an illegitimate act nor recognized the resulting victim status. The abduction, its illegality, and the condition of victim are now expressly acknowledged under Law 20/2022. Biological identity had been restored; this Declaration formally recognizes the nature of the acts that made that restoration necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general terms, the double filiation ruling represents an innovative judicial resolution because of its legal scope and its recognition of biological identity with full civil effects. On a personal level, however, for Olmo Gómez Aldaz, recognition as a victim carries a different and deeper meaning. The civil restitution left the adoption intact and did not declare the existence of a crime nor the illegality of the acts in the terms requested. The Declaration of Recognition and Personal Reparation, by contrast, expressly affirms the abduction, its illegitimate character, and the condition of victim, thereby completing what the strictly civil route had not achieved.
