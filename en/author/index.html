          <h2>Author</h2>

          <p><strong>Olmo Gómez Aldaz</strong> is an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0G3HMBLDG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">author</a>
, public communicator, and activist against identicide. His work originates from a real case of baby trafficking, identity theft, and fraudulent adoption that took 
            place in Bilbao (Spain) in 1971. Separated from his mother at birth and registered under a false identity, decades later he reconstructed his origins 
            through personal investigation, historical archives, and genetic evidence, ultimately obtaining judicial recognition of his biological filiation.</p>

          <p>He has turned this process into a narrated archive: books, documents, and materials that allow the case to be followed step by step. He is the author 
            of <em>DOGA 2025</em> and offers this website as a public repository and reference space for readers, journalists, and affected individuals. His aim is 
            to leave a verifiable record of what occurred and to contribute to public debate on identity, origin, and institutional responsibility.</p>

        <h2>About my identity</h2>
        <p>
          Treat me with respect.<br>
          Do not call me ungrateful. Do not call me thankless.<br>
          Do not tell me that I owe anyone anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not bind me to an identity that does not resonate with me, that I do not feel as my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some time now, I have identified with my nature, with my biology, with who I truly am.<br>
          And I believe I have the right to bear the surnames that correspond to me by origin, not by imposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am not denying affection nor erasing bonds.<br>
          I am claiming my name, my identity, and my place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing more. And nothing less.
