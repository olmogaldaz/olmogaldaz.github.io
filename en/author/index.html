          <h2>Author</h2>

          <p><strong>Olmo Gómez Aldaz</strong> is an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0G3HMBLDG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">author</a>, 
            public communicator, and activist against identicide. His work originates from a real case of baby trafficking, identity theft, and fraudulent adoption 
            that took place in Bilbao (Spain) in 1971. Separated from his mother at birth and registered under a false identity, decades later he reconstructed his
            origins through personal investigation, historical archives, and genetic evidence, ultimately obtaining judicial recognition of his biological filiation.</p>

          <p>He has turned this process into a narrated archive: books, documents, and materials that allow the case to be followed step by step. He is the author 
            of <em>DOGA 2025</em> and offers this website as a public repository and reference space for readers, journalists, and affected individuals. His aim is 
            to leave a verifiable record of what occurred and to contribute to public debate on identity, origin, and institutional responsibility.</p>
